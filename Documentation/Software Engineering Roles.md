Roles and Contributions
======

**This is just to begin finding a good format** for presenting member roles and their contributions. Be sure to keep track of your time for each section you work on. I've made some very rough estimates to get a start, but **this will be heavily tweaked** as we move forward. The roles and contributions are obviously not set in stone since we haven't even discussed it yet. *Send any additions to Davis Engeler via email.* If you lost it, contact me directly.
